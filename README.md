# DATA STRUCTURE COLLECTION SELF-MADE

General repository for collecting my own implementations of Data Structures using C.

## UTILS.H

During the creation of my DSs, I've been adding some common functions, structs and enumerations that may be found useful for many operations performed within the DSs I am writing. Therefore, here's an overview of what you can find:
+ [enum] exit_codes
+ [enum] boolean
+ [function] compare
+ [function] copy

## VECTOR.H

The first DS that I have implemented was a Vector.
A vector is a dinamic array that allows the programmer to dinamically add or remove elements from an array at runtime.
There are many operations you can perform using its functions, so here's an overview:
+ [constant] VECTOR_INIT_CAPACITY, VECTOR_INIT_SIZE, VECTOR_DEFAULT_ITEMSIZE, VECTOR_DEFAULT_TYPESIZE
+ [struct] members
+ [struct] SVector
+ [function] update_capacity
+ [function] assign
+ [function] at
+ [function] back
+ [function] capacity
+ [function] clear
+ [function] count
+ [function] empty
+ [function] erase_element
+ [function] erase_index
+ [function] fill
+ [function] find
+ [function] free
+ [function] front
+ [function] get_item_size
+ [function] get_type_size
+ [function] insert
+ [function] pop_back
+ [function] push_back
+ [function] resize
+ [function] shrink
+ [function] size
+ [function] vector_init
